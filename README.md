# mqtt ACL's for shelly devices
Simple repo for documenting required acls for full mqtt functionality

# Notes
* ACL's are based on mosquitto acl engine
* ACL's are a bit broad due to the way access is controled in MQTT. There is no way to match on substring of topic (depending on software)
* ACL's are maintained on best effort basis

# Requests
Feel free to use the issues system to request changes/modifications. The acl's for devices i own are tested and work as expected. ACL's for other devices will be added on best effort basis. If you want speciffic device added just open an Issue. Note i would greatly appreciate a test device :)
